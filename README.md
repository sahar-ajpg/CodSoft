# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. 

Using passenger information such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port, classification models were trained to predict survival outcomes.

This is a binary classification problem where:
- 0 = Did not survive
- 1 = Survived

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

- PassengerId – Unique ID of passenger
- Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Sex – Gender of passenger
- Age – Age of passenger
- SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch – Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare – Ticket fare
- Cabin – Cabin number
- Embarked – Port of embarkation
- Survived – Target variable
